### Hello humans


I'm a back-end software engineer.

- I’m currently working at Kunumi.
- Previously, I worked at Swile, Loft and iFood.
- I organize software conferences at DevIsland
- Fun facts: I'm a snare drum player on Brazilian carnival and a french horn wanna be


So long and thanks for all the fish
